# Angular Joyride 
An Angular Tour (Joyride) library built entirely in Angular, without using any heavy external dependencies like Bootstrap or JQuery.
From now on you can easily guide your users through your site showing them all the sections and features.

For Angular 2+ (2, 4, 5, 6, 7)

You should not download this package, use the original version which is https://github.com/tnicola/ngx-joyride as this fork was just used to adapt very specific requirements from a project. All credits from this fork are to tnicola.
